Explanation of what each file contains:

Small_space.csv:  Contains the small hypothesis space structure and its' node map 
full_space.csv: Contains the large hypothesis space structure and its' node map 
word_learning.py: Contains the code for generating and analysing the mode
proposal_eval.R: Contains code to plot the traceplots, co-relation plots etc. to compare proposal functions
generalization_plot.py: Code to plot the generalization results for the large hypothesis space
generalization_plot_small.py: Code to plot the generalization results for the small hypothesis space
Pickle files (folder): These files contain the output of the model for all the main clusters in the hypothesis space.
              This data is used by the plot scripts to plot the results.
              It contains results for all the different priors which I tried.
